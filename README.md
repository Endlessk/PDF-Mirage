To built a conference simulation system reproducing the INFOCOM automatic assignment process described in [1]. We imported into this system 114 TPC members from a well-known recent security conference as reviewers, and downloaded a collection of each of these reviewersâ€™ papers published in recent years. In total, this comprised 2094 papers used as training data for the automatic reviewer assignment system.
